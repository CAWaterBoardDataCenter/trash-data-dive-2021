### What are the breakout groups?

Participants should select 1-2 breakout *groups* to return to during breakout *sessions* throughout the event.

**Assessing Utility of Track 2 Trash Amendment Data Collection Strategies Throughout California**  
**Organizers:** Dr. Win Cowger, Gary Conley, Jarma Bennett, and Dr. Julian Fulton  
Track 2 trash amendment compliance is happening throughout the state. Municipal entities are implementing interventions to litter and assessing how effective they are. With little guidance from the state about exactly how to assess intervention efficacy, there will likely be many challenges ahead for comparing efficacy metrics across jurisdictions. This may be a roadblock for figuring out which intervention strategies are the best and how to increase our reductions in litter in the future. This workgroup will focus on the state of track 2 reporting and data collection, identify similarities and differences between the data, and share preliminary knowledge about the efficacy of the variety of strategies being tested to prevent and cleanup litter throughout the state. 


**Remote ecosystem to tell trash stories**  
**Organizers:** Shelly Moore, *TBD*  
Past datathons have discussed the importance and need for storytelling on trash. This breakout would provide a virtual platform and tools to tell trash stories. *More information to come*


**Machine learning to make trash data clean**  
**Organizers:** Walter Yu & Tony Hale  
Description TBD. 


**Trash education and outreach** - *tentative*  
**Organizers:** Michelle Alexander, *TBD*  
Description TBD.
